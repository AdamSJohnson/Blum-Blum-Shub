Easy to use! Hopefully this is perfectly correct.

Step 1: import PRNGBBS

Step 2: Call PRNGBBS.generate_random_bits(n_bits,length [,c=n]) 

n_bits is required for the number of bits to use for the primes p and q. 

length is the number of bits to give back that are randomized.

optional: c=n is the number of LSBs to grab per iteration. Default is c=1.
